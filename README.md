# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab

This repo contains small hands-on projects, practice tasks, and notes related to cybersecurity. The goal is to improve my skills consistently by building tools, recreating attack scenarios, and documenting CTF-style exercises.

## 🔍 Structure

- `recon/` – Scripts and tools for information gathering and scanning
- `web-attacks/` – Local apps with common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
- `ctf-practice/` – Write-ups and flags from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, VulnHub, etc.
- `tools/` – Small utilities and helper scripts (port scanner, hash cracker, etc.)
- `notes/` – Reference materials, cheat sheets, and personal notes

## 🧠 Motivation

- Practice offensive techniques legally and ethically
- Automate and document learning
- Use this repo as a personal wiki + toolkit
